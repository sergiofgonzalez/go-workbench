# Mini-project: Hello bytesize!
> a minimalist library to display storage sizes in a friendly way.

The goal of this mini-project is to illustrate how to use `iota` for creating enumerations, and how this can be pushed to create a library that can be used to display storage sizes in bytes such as 1024 bytes, as "1.00 KB".
