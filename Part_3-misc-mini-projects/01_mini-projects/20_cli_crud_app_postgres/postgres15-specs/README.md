# Postgres 15.2 container with volume mapping
> a Postgres 15.2 server container in which the data directory is mapped to a host directory (outside the container) to foster container's stateless-ness

## Description
This file contains technical details describing how the container image was built and some info about the decisions taken.

For details about how to build the container image and run it, please refer to the container's [README.md](./postgres15-container/README.md.

The container specification found in [./postgres15-container](postgres15-container/Dockerfile) is a simple Postgres 15.2 server Docker container specification in which the data directory (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`) is mapped to a volume outside of the container in the working directory (`/.pgdata`).

As a result all the stateful data generated by the container will be available in the host file system, and can be reused with different containers.
