    "The arrays underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice. The *capacity* is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice. It can be discovered using the function `cap()`.\n",

    "A slice of length up to that capacity can be created by slicing a new one from the original slice.\n",

    "A new, initialized slide value for a given element type T may be created using the built-in funciton `make([]T, length, capacity)`, with `capacity` being optional. This function allocates a hidden array to which the returned slice refers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like arrays, slices are always one dimensional, but may be composed to construct higher-dimensional objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using slices of slices, the inner lengths may vary dynamically. Moreover, the inner slices must be initialized individually.\n"
