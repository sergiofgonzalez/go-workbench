    "## Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Go includes the *gofmt* program, available as `go fmt` that reads a Go program and emits the source in a standard style of indentation and vertical alignment, retaining and if necessary reformatting comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The *untidied*:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "type T struct {\n",
    "\tname string // name of the object\n",
    "\tvalue int // its value\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Will be transformed by *gofmt* into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "type T struct {\n",
    "\tname  string // name of the object\n",
    "\tvalue int    // its value\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "| NOTE: |\n",
    "| :---- |\n",
    "| You must configure VSCode with `gofmt` in the settings. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "+ Tabs are used for indentation, and *gofmt* emits them by default. Spaces should be used only if you must.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because of this, it's not that important whether you set your tab size to 2, 4 or 8. I use two because it makes the code more compact horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ There is no length limit in Go. If a line feels too long, wrap it and indent with an extra tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Go needs fewer parentheses than C and Java."

    "### Package names\n",
    "\n",
    "When a package name is imported, the package name becomes the accessor for the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, after:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "import \"bytes\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can do `bytes.Buffer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, packages are given lowercase, single-word names; there should be no need for underscore or mixedcaps. The package names should be short, concise, and evocative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another convention is that the package name is the base name of its source directory. For example, a package in `src/encoding/base64` will be imported as `import \"encoding/base64\"` and the package name will be `base64` and not `encoding_base64` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, think of the end-users: when exposing a function in your package use a concise name like `Reader` instead of `BufReader`, as the users will refer to it as `bufio.Reader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when creating new instances of a particular type defined in a package, it is recommended to use something like `New()` instead of `NewRing()` if the package only exports a single type (as it should). This is because the end-users will code `ring.New()` to refer to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, short names with a helpful doc comment is preferred over a long name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "// discouraged\n",
    "once.DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup)\n",

    "Go doesn't provide automatic support for getters and setters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that you cannot use them, but it's not consider idiomatic, nor necessary to put `Get` into the getter's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, it's preferred to use the name of the object (uppercase, exported) instead of `GetField()`, while for the setter it is OK to use `SetField()`\n",

    "\n",
