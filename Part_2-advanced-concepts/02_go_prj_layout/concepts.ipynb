    "There is not a particular Go project layout and when an article or repo promotes a particular Go project layout as \"standard\" it's a framework smell.\n",

    "+ `internal/`: packages inside the `internal/` directory are not accesible outside the Go module it belongs to. If you expose a package to the public, it becomes a public API, so you have to ensure it follows semver. Use the `internal/` directory to avoid this situation. Even the Go toolchain follows this convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `testdata/`: put ancillary test data inside this directory. Go toolchain will ignore anything inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Go toolchain will also ignore any directory starting with `.` or `_`.\n",
