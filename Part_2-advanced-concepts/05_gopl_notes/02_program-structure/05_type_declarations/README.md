# tempconv
> Temperature conversion using named types

## v0

Create a program that features a package `tempconv` that performs Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions.

In that package define:
  + an exported named type `Celsius` for temperatures using Celsius scale.
  + an exported named type `Fahrenheit` for temperatures using Fahrenheit scale.
  + the following constants:
    + AbsoluteZeroC: absolute zero temp in Celsius
    + FreezingC: water freezing point in Celsius
    + BoilingC: water boiling point in Celsius
  + the functions `CtoF` and `FtoC` that perform the conversions between the two scales.

  + Create string methods for both types
