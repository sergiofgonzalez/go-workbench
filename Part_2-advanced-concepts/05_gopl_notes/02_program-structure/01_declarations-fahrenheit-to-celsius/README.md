Create a program that defines a function `fToC` that takes a floating point argument representing a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

In `main`, create a couple of constants with the values at which the water freezes and boils (32.0 and 212.0 respectively) and print the equivalent values by invoking the function (HINT: use %g as the format specifier for the floating point).
